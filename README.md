We want Fyyur to be the next new platform that artists and musical venues can use to find each other, and discover new music shows. Let's make that happen!

## Tech Stack (Dependencies)

### 1. Backend Dependencies
Our tech stack will include the following:
 * **virtualenv** as a tool to create isolated Python environments
 * **SQLAlchemy ORM** to be our ORM library of choice
 * **PostgreSQL** as our database of choice
 * **Python3** and **Flask** as our server language and server framework
 * **Flask-Migrate** for creating and running schema migrations

### 2. Frontend Dependencies
You must have the **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript** with [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/customize/) for our website's frontend.
